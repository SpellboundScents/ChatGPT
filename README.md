## 📖 About This Fork

This project is a **modern fork** of [isaccanedo/ChatGPT](https://github.com/isaccanedo/ChatGPT), which itself was forked from the original [lencx/ChatGPT](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT) project.  

Both upstream forks did excellent work building a cross-platform desktop wrapper for [OpenAI’s ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com).  
This fork continues that lineage with the goal of:

- 🔄 **Bringing the project up-to-date with the latest ChatGPT models and features**  
- 🛠 **Maintaining compatibility** with current OpenAI web features  
- 📦 **Modernizing the build system & updater** so future releases come directly from this repository  
- 🧹 **Cleaning up legacy dependencies and update feeds** from previous forks  

---

## ✨ Current Progress

So far, the following changes have been made:

- Migrated codebase into a new fork (`this repository`) with its own identity.  
- Updated package metadata, app identifiers, and build configuration.  
- Re-wired the Tauri auto-updater to point at **this repo’s releases** (instead of lencx’s).  
- Generated a **new updater signing keypair** (so only builds from this fork are trusted).  
- Began revising the documentation (this README) to reflect the new direction.
- Fixed a lot of UI bugs, especially in chats with code blocks
- Upgraded from Tauri 1.x to 2.x
- Revised Menubar
- Removed code for Windows and Mac. 
  - OpenAI has their own desktop apps for these OSes so I will keep this Linux only.
    - Everything is built & tested on Zorin/Ubuntu using VSC.

---

## 🚀 Roadmap

- ✅ Set up updater infrastructure (GitHub Actions + signed releases).  
- ✅ Update app internals for **latest ChatGPT models & UI changes**.  
- ✅ Improve build workflows for Linux.

- ⏳ Refresh app branding & assets to distinguish from upstream.  
- ⏳ Continue squashing UI bugs
- ⏳ Speed Up Loading Times
- ⏳ Re-work Configuration Menu
